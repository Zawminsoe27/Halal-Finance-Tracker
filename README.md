# Halal Finance Tracker

A simple, local-first personal finance tracker focused on halal-friendly budgeting and expense tracking. This repository contains a minimal web app (HTML/CSS/JS) for tracking income, expenses, and viewing simple reports.

**Features:**
- Track income and expenses
- Categorize transactions (e.g., Groceries, Bills, Zakat)
- Monthly summary and running balance
- Lightweight, client-side single-page app (no server required)

**Quick Start**
- Open [index.html](index.html) in your browser to run the app locally.
- For a simple local server (recommended for some browser features):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

**Project Structure**
- index.html — main UI
- css/ — styles
- js/ — JavaScript app logic
- assets/ — images and icons

**Development**
- Edit files in `js/` and `css/`, then reload the browser.
- Consider using a live-reload extension or a small dev server for faster feedback.
